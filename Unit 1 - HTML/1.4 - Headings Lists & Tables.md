### Bored? Find this too easy so far?

Have a read through:
- The entire list of HTML tags [by category](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) or [by alphabet](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
- You could read [the HTML syntax guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- Have a look at [properly indenting your HTML code](https://granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html)

### Headings

**Bold text** is fine, but it's not a _heading_. We might want a larger font and maybe the possibility of a subheading.

HTML has 6 levels of built-in "headings". **Note:** these are different than the `<title>` tag!
