### Bored? Is it too easy so far?

Have a read through:
- The entire list of HTML tags [by category](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) or [by alphabet](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
- You could read [the HTML syntax guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- Have a look at [properly indenting your HTML code](https://granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html)

### Headings

**Bold text** is fine, but it's not a _heading_. We might want a larger font and maybe the possibility of a subheading.

HTML has 6 levels of built-in "headings". **Note:** these are different than the `<title>` tag!

The **largest** is "level 1": `<h1> My Title </h1>`  
As you increase in level, you decrease in size: `<h2> Subtitle </h2>`  
There are also `<h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>`

These come in handy, especially if you start to learn how to style your website (that's later in Unit 1).

### Lists

Lists are handy:
- They organize data
- They provide visual organization
  - You can have sublists
    - Or sub-sub-lists
- These are called "unordered" lists because there are no numbers

To create an unordered list, start with the `<ul>` tag:
```HTML
<ul>
</ul>
```

But that's just an _empty_ nothing... To have **items** in your list, you need the **list item** tag `<li>`:
```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Pants</li>
  <li>Socks</li>
  <li>Shirts</li>
  <li>Hoodie</li>
</ul>
```

Think of the list item tag like a paragraph tag - it contains stuff.  
For a sub-list, create another `<ul>` inside a `<li>`:
```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Pants</li>
  <li>Socks</li>
  <li>Shirts:
    <ul>
      <li>Hoodie</li>
      <li>T-Shirt</li>
      <li>Longsleeve</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
```

To have numbers on your list, you need an **ordered list** `<ol>`:
```HTML
<h4>Steps to make pasta:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Fill pot with water</li>
  <li>Place water on the stove</li>
  <li>Set burner to high</li>
  <li>Allow water to boil</li>
</ol>
```
Ordered lists can have sub-lists, too.

Give it a try!

### Tables

To create a grid of columns and rows, similar to a spreadsheet, you use the `<table>` tag. Similar to lists, you need other tags inside it.

First, you define a **row** with the **t**able **r**ow tag `<tr>` then you use **t**able **d**ata tags to define a _cell_ or box.

```HTML
<h3>Weekly Schedule</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday</td>
    <td>Tuesday</td>
    <td>Wednesday</td>
    <td>Thursday</td>
    <td>Friday</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Push-ups</td>
    <td>Weights</td>
    <td>Cardio</td>
    <td>Leg Day</td>
    <td>Cheat Day</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
That will create something similar to this:

<h3>Weekly Schedule</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday</td>
    <td>Tuesday</td>
    <td>Wednesday</td>
    <td>Thursday</td>
    <td>Friday</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Push-ups</td>
    <td>Weights</td>
    <td>Cardio</td>
    <td>Leg Day</td>
    <td>Cheat Day</td>
  </tr>
</table>


# Your Task

Update your "index" and "About Me" pages.
- Include a heading instead of just bolded text at the top
- In "About Me" create a list of things you like and a list of things you don't like. _Use headings to introduce them_.
- At the bottom of "About Me" create a _table_ that shows your schedule for semester 2. For example, login to [my.studentinfo.ca](https://my.studentinfo.ca/) and check your schedule - it's a table!

<br>

### Sir, is there anything else I can do?

- Look up table headings `<th>`
- Look up how to remove the borders on the table
  - Or make them look nicer
- Find out how to customize the dot or number in `<ul>` and `<ol>`
- Check out tutorials at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
